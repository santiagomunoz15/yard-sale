My first JavaScript project is a dynamic web page that utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes interactive elements that allow users to input 
and manipulate data, and the page responds in real-time.

### Elements that work correctly at the moment:
* User/Login menu 
* Shopping Cart menu (Add and remove products, and get the total price of the products in the cart)
* Add to cart buttons
* Product detail (click product images)
* Responsive Design


### Possible future features:
1. User authentication: Implement user registration and login functionality to allow users to create accounts, access personalized features, or save their preferences.

2. Search functionality: Add a search bar that allows users to search for specific products or content within your website.

3. Sorting and filtering: Provide options for sorting and filtering products based on different criteria, such as price, popularity, or category.

4. Product reviews and ratings: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for products, providing valuable feedback and enhancing the shopping experience.

5. Wishlist or favorites: Enable users to save products to a wishlist or favorites list for future reference or easy access.

6. Social sharing: Add social media sharing buttons to allow users to share products or content from your website on their social media platforms.

7. Analytics and tracking: Integrate website analytics tools to gather data on user behavior, traffic sources, and other relevant metrics to gain insights and optimize your website.

8. Related products or recommended items: Implement a feature that suggests related products or recommends items based on user browsing history or purchase patterns.

9. Order management: Develop functionality for users to view and manage their orders, track shipment status, and view order history.
